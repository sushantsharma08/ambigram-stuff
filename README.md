# Ambigrams
>It is a web application with a functionality of checking whether the entered number is [Strobogrammatic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strobogrammatic-number/ ) and [Palindorme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number) or not.


### Strobogrammatic Number
 - ***A Strobogrammatic Number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees.***
 - Example#1: 0 after 180° rotation : (0 → 0) : **Its a strobogramatic no.**
 - Example#2: 6 after 180° rotation : (6 → 9) : **not a strobogramatic no.**


### Palindorme Number
 - ***A Palindrome is a number (such as 16461) that remains the same when its digits are reversed.***
 - Example#1: a given number is 12321 , when reversed it is read 12321 : **Its a plindrome no.**
 - Example#2: A given number is 12345 , when reversed it is read 54321 : **not a plindrome no.**
